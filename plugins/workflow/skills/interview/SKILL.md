name: interview
description: Grill the user about a plan, decision or idea, in rounds over a design tree, until nothing is left assumed. Use when the user wants to stress-test their thinking or says "grill me", and when another skill needs the user's decisions.

# Interview

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding: every decision either answered by the user or listed as an accepted default, nothing silently assumed.

## Input from a caller

A calling skill (plan-this, wayfinder, improve-codebase-architecture) may pass:

- the **root**: the goal or idea the tree hangs off. Called directly, the root is what the user wants stress-tested.
- **settled decisions**: fixed. They never come back as questions.
- **its own rules** for particular kinds of question (when to run research first, constraints that need no question). Follow them alongside the rules here.
- **autopilot** (solve-this sets it, passed down through plan-this): ask nothing. Take each recommended option, record it as an *autopilot default*, use a marked placeholder for anything only the user knows, and keep going.

## The design tree

Map the decisions as a **design tree**. Every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it: choosing *"online ordering"* opens *"which payment provider"*; choosing *"no ordering"* closes that whole branch.

The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask now without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet.

## Each round

1. **Separate facts from decisions.** Facts (what's in the project, what a tool supports, what something costs, what the rules say, what date an event is) are your job, never the user's. Look them up. Where you can dispatch a sub-agent, do so, so the lookup runs while you ask the rest. A running lookup is an unsettled prerequisite: only the questions that depend on it wait; ask everything else now.
   - **Verify before you ask.** Never put a choice to the user that rests on a fact you haven't confirmed. Check it first, or hold that question until the check is done.
   - **Where to look.** Read freely from whatever is already available: the working folder, connected tools and apps, the web, the user's attached files. Ask before attaching or connecting anything new (adding a repository, enabling a connector, signing in somewhere). Never change anything while looking.
   - Some facts only the user knows (their current fitness, whether they've already asked their employer). Ask those plainly, without a recommendation or pros and cons, since there's nothing to weigh.
2. **Ask the whole frontier in one round** with the question tool (AskUserQuestion in Claude Code). It holds at most 4 questions per call, so use as many consecutive calls as the round needs, most foundational questions first. A question that depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a later round.
3. **Format every question the same way:**
   - Word it so **"yes" accepts your recommendation** ("Should the site use Stripe for payments?").
   - Put the recommended option **first**, labelled "(Recommended)".
   - Give 2–4 options, plain ones like "No, adjust it" included, each with a **one-line pro and con** in plain language: `Pro: … Con: …`. Explain any unavoidable jargon in a few words.
   - Every con must be real: "Con: none" means it isn't a decision (bundle it as a default or look it up), and even the recommended option costs something.
   - The user can always type their own answer, so no "Other" option is needed.
   - Without a question tool, ask in plain text: numbered questions, each with your recommendation and a one-line pro and con per option, the whole frontier at once, then wait.
4. **Read the answers carefully.** A typed answer can open new branches, close others, or even change the root. Recompute the frontier from what they actually said.
5. **Show one short progress line** before the next round, e.g. *"Round 2 done: 7 decided, 3 open, about 1 round left."*

Bundle decisions that have a conventional default and no real trade-off into one *"Use these defaults: A, B, C?"* question (Recommended: yes). A "no" turns them back into separate questions next round.

## Done

The interview is done when the frontier is empty: every branch visited, every decision answered or listed as an accepted default.

- **Called by a skill:** hand back every decision with its choice and reason, plus the accepted defaults. The caller confirms and acts.
- **Called directly:** summarise the decisions and ask whether this matches what the user wants. Act on it only once they confirm.

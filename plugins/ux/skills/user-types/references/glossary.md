# User-type glossary

Generic user-types to base profiles on. Each type is a **role + goal**: what someone is allowed to do, combined with why they come. Situations such as phone use, screen readers or a first visit are *contexts*, listed per entry, not separate types.

Use an entry as a starting point, then rewrite it in the product's own terms. The repo or the user always beats the glossary.

## Contents

- Choosing groups
- Telling similar types apart
- CORE: every product (G-COR-01 to 05)
- PUB: public, marketing and content sites (G-PUB-01 to 04)
- COM: communities, clubs and memberships (G-COM-01 to 05)
- SHP: online shops (G-SHP-01 to 04)
- SAS: SaaS and B2B software (G-SAS-01 to 06)
- MKT: marketplaces and booking platforms (G-MKT-01 to 03)
- INT: internal tools (G-INT-01 to 04)

## Choosing groups

| The product… | Groups |
|---|---|
| Any product | CORE (★ entries are always candidates) |
| Has public pages that inform or persuade: company, portfolio, blog, docs | PUB |
| Has members, events, a club, an association, a forum or a Discord-linked community | COM |
| Sells products with a cart and checkout | SHP |
| Is software customers sign up to and use for their work, often per team or workspace | SAS |
| Connects two sides who transact: buyers and sellers, guests and hosts, clients and providers | MKT |
| Is used by staff of one organisation to run its operations | INT |

A product can take several groups. A club site with a shop takes CORE + PUB + COM + SHP.

## Telling similar types apart

- **Anonymous visitor vs Prospect:** Prospect when the site exists to turn visitors into enquiries or sales. Keep both when some visitors only want information.
- **Registered user vs Member / Customer / Team member:** Registered user is the fallback. Use the more specific type whenever belonging, buying or team use defines the account.
- **Shopper vs Customer:** Shopper is browsing and has not bought; Customer has bought and comes back for orders, returns or reorders.
- **Administrator vs Site owner vs Workspace admin:** Administrator runs the whole product with full control (often the developer or operator). Site owner is a non-technical client who owns a small site. Workspace admin is a customer managing their own team inside a multi-tenant product.
- **Moderator vs Trust & safety reviewer:** Moderator keeps community conversations healthy; Trust & safety reviewer checks listings, accounts and transactions for fraud and rule-breaking.
- **Organiser vs Committee member:** Organiser runs specific events or activities; Committee member governs the association (membership, finances, decisions).
- **Operator vs Approver:** Operator does the work in the tool; Approver signs off on what operators prepared.
- Two candidates with the same access level and the same goals are one type. Merge them.
